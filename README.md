# JPEG-Lossless-Encoder

This program was created based on a programming assignment for my FAU course CAP6010: Multimedia Systems.
It is a JPEG Lossless Encoder that makes use of 7 different techniques for encoding and decogin a 16x16 JPEG image.

Image must be in the form of a 16x16 pixel image written using integers from 1 to 256. An example for format is provided in the image.txt file.

Formulas evaluated are:
1. X = A
2. X = B
3. X = C
4. X = A + B - C
5. X = A + (B - C) / 2
6. X = B + (A - C) / 2
7. X = (A + B) / 2

Final report with results is found in the root of the repo.
